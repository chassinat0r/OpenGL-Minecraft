# OpenGL-Minecraft

## What is this project?

I am working on this project to help me learn OpenGL and 3D game development in C++. I want to use it to make my own games and decided a building game similar to Minecraft Classic would be a good way to get used to the libraries.

## Disclaimer

This is not affiliated or endorsed by Mojang or Microsoft. This is entirely my own project. You can use the project for personal purposes or look at the code to help you with your own OpenGL projects.

The textures are extracted from an old version of Minecraft, I believe alpha or classic. They are not my own textures.
